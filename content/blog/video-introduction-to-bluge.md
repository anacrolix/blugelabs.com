On September 29th we released the [first developer preview of Bluge](https://blugelabs.com/blog/bluge-developer-preview/), and my sponsors were invited to join a video introduction, followed by an open discussion.  The presentation portion of this was recorded, and is now being made available to the public.

Two more introductory sessions are planned, the next one focusing on the completely rewritten aggregation framework.  [Become a sponsor](https://blugelabs.com/thanks/) to secure your invitation to these calls.
