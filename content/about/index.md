My name is <a href="https://github.com/mschoch/">Marty Schoch</a>, and this is Bluge Labs.

Back in 2014 when work first began on <a href="https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve/">Bleve</a> at <a href="https://www.couchbase.com/">Couchbase</a> we were determined to create a true open-source community around the project.  Everyone involved is extremely proud of how the project grew and matured over time.

In 2020, we launched Bluge a new search library, built on the same foundation as Bleve.  Bluge offers more features, a smaller codebase, and an easier to use API for developers.
